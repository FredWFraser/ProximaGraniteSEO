          "We" is Fred Fraser, owner and operator of Proxima Granite SEO!
          Proxima Granite is my brain child and is the product of unemployment.
          I lost my job as software engineer and was looking for direction. I
          took several courses and eventually was led to a course in full stack
          web development. It was a learning experience, with lots of highs and
          some lows and was the toughest course I ever took. I thought this was
          something I could do at home as a business. I also discovered
          something called SEO, which I was previously unaware of, and took a
          couple of courses. I then a took a course on WordPress. I wanted to
          use all my newly found knowledge and not be stuck forever in a place
          called "tutorial hell". So here I am embarking on a business adventure
          to see where it will lead. I have worked recently as a software QA
          engineer, briefly as a test technician, as a bill collector and office
          manager. I love to work with others and I come from a technical space
          so I can work comfortably with a developer if the need arises, or work
          with you on the technical aspects of your website. I have worked in a
          collaborive environment and not afraid of opposing viewpoints. I
          appreciate the diversity of ideas. As my company begins and grows, I
          am thankful for the chance you would be a part of my journey, as well
          as me being a part of yours. In my personal time, I enjoy songwriting
          and producing music in my home studio, as well as distance running.
