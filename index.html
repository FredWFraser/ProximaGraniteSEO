        <br />
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          "Proxima" generally refers to Proxima Centauri, the closest star to
          our Sun. It is a red dwarf star located in the constellation
          Centaurus, approximately 4.24 light-years away. "Granite" refers to
          New Hampshire being known as the "Granite State". Granite also
          symbolizes strength, durability and endurance. Just like that star, we
          strive to be the clear choice for New Hampshire businesses searching
          for a better online presence.
