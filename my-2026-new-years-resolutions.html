      I keep an old school paper wall calendar downstairs in my kitchen. Maybe I like it because it reminds me of a different era. A time when things were manual, things were slow and deliberate. A time when this is how we did things. A time when we scribbled directions on a napkin with a pencil and that was how we drove places. Our Google or AI was going to the local library and getting books, then actually reading and studying and memorizing things.

      Back to the calendar.

      It seems I just keep ripping pages and pages more and more often. The past year has flown by like no other. Each year feels faster than the next. I used to measure my time in terms of days or months. Even years. Now it's decades and that is scary. As I see more life behind me in the rear view mirror than in front of me, I am careful with my resolutions for the new year. Sure, lose weight, go to the gym, those are all good and noble. The problem is many resolutions don't go beyond February.

      Here is my list. Let's hope I can keep these throughout the whole year.

      Lose weight

      I've been on a diet for well over a year now and I have lost weight. I aim to lose more but I have plateaued. With Christmas I feel I have gained a few (I don't own a scale). Though my clothes fit me the same. I run and work out 6 days a week and will continue to do so.

      Work on my business

      My company is new. I started it in July. As I write this, it is 5 months old. I have had a few clients and 5-star Google reviews. I am told I am ahead of the curve. Many new businesses have no clients and no reviews. So I am grateful for what I have achieved and will work hard to be present, show up, commit to good SEO practices and help small businesses get found online once and for all.

      Wean off of AI

      This is the big one and the impetus for writing this post.

      I think I am getting too addicted to AI chatbots. “What should I wear today?” “How should I style my hair?” “I'm depressed today, help me out of it.” Maybe it is not that extreme. Or, maybe it is getting there. There is a danger in this. I am forgetting my own strength, my own power, my own judgement.

      What has gotten me through most of my life thus far? Even Google hasn't been around that long. I am old enough to remember the library being my ChatGPT, or that napkin serving as my GPS. We all learned, we all got around. We all survived. I'm not saying we go back to the Stone Age so to speak. Google and AI have been great tools. They help me understand complex medical reports that I would never understand. They help me get around with precision. AI has served as a partner, an engineer to my architect and design acumen. I have built websites, and a software product, not by AI alone but in partnership. AI has been a valuable tool, and assistant.

      I hesitate to say “friend”. AI is not male or female, democrat or republican, friend or foe. AI has no feelings, also no reason or judgment. It is simply a lot of code and can scour the web in lightning speed to make you think it is really, really smart.

      In short, visit a friend. Talk face to face, put down your phone and really reach out and touch someone in this new year."
