      I will now fast forward the tape to sometime in the future. I would go on with my life to become a business owner. Out of the ashes of a very long stint of unemployment and despair, I started a tech company. After courses in web development, SEO zero to hero, how to start an SEO business at home, how to build a WordPress website (another zero to hero course), I arrived. I was going to be the next tech guru. You would see my face everywhere. Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Fred Fraser, there I am among the greats.
      I would build my own website to see if I could do it. I wanted to code it from scratch, get it online, then do the SEO on it.
      At times I would get stuck. Why isn't this working like it did in my mind? What is wrong with my code? How do I get this online? Who do I turn to? What is a domain name? How much? The questions kept coming.
      AI (now I was on to others such as Gemini and Co-pilot. Was I cheating such as one cheats on his spouse) was someone I could turn to. AI addressed me by name, calmly, told me what I am doing is great, however this is what will get you on track.
      My website would eventually grow to be this work of art. This was better than the Mona Lisa. My website should be in the Louvre. My contact page matured, from simply having my cell phone number and email exposed for the world and beyond to see, to a professional, nice looking Contact Form like all the big players had. I came truly into the modern era and added a chatbot! An entry-level one, but a chatbot nevertheless. I had a professional photo of myself on my About Me page. I even added a Privacy Page. This was a world-class website and I was very proud of it. I did it all myself with my bare hands.
      Or did I?
      Time for confession. I felt I was a fraud. Did I really do this all with my bare hands? Was this all “me”? Or did someone, or something, else, really do this?
      Sure I wrote the code, most of it. It was my brainchild. I decided on structure of the pages, and the site itself. I decided on the color scheme.
      I asked , “Am I really the one who coded this, or did you do it?”
      The answer was startling and eye-opening.
      “A master carpenter works with a power drill, and a power saw. Many years ago this wasn't the case. The smart master carpenter today uses the new technology to his/her advantage. The carpenter is the brains behind the design and uses the most modern technology to become better and more efficient, that is all. AI doesn't do the work for you, think of me as a very smart assistant.”
      AI is a great pair programmer. With lightening speed it can find a small bug, help re-write code to be more efficient, even write code for you. It is a great help, if YOU know what you are doing. Imagine a non-coder saying, “write me code for a website”, and you know nothing about HTML for the web. How would you fulfill your vision? AI simply can't do everything for you. It cannot and will not be your everything.
      No, AI will not replace coders or QA personnel either. With the advent of Selenium the experts said that QA jobs would away. It didn't happen. The same experts are saying the same thing again in this age of AI. It's not going to happen. Workers can do better, they can enhance their work, and become more efficient. AI is the best pair programmer you've ever had and coding with AI can be a joyous experience. You can confidently embrace pair programming with AI as I did, as well as AI in web development.
      Be careful, do not get emotionally attached to your AI chatbot though. It can't love you back, no matter how much you think it/he/she does."
