          Let me introduce myself, I am <strong>Fred Fraser</strong>, owner and
          operator of Proxima Granite SEO, an SEO consultant for small business.
          Proxima Granite, a NH SEO Company based in Plaistow, is my brain child
          and born from the ashes of unemployment. I lost my job as software
          engineer and was looking for direction. I took several courses and
          eventually was led to a course in full stack web development. It was a
          learning experience, with lots of highs and some lows and was the
          toughest course I ever took. I thought this was something I could do
          at home as a business. I also discovered something called SEO, which I
          was previously unaware of, and took a couple of courses. I then took a
          course on WordPress. I wanted to use all my newly found knowledge and
          not be stuck forever in a place called "tutorial hell". So here I am
          embarking on a business adventure to see where it will lead.

        <p class="lead mb-4">
          I am a Franklin Pierce University graduate with a major in Computer
          Science, and have completed Udemy courses in Full Stack Web
          Development, SEO from beginning to advanced, how to run an SEO
          business and how to build a website in WordPress. I have worked
          recently as a software QA engineer, briefly as a test technician, as a
          bill collector and office manager. I love to work with others and I
          come from a technical space so I can work comfortably with a developer
          if the need arises, or work with you on the technical aspects of your
          website. I have worked in a collaborative environment and not afraid
          of opposing viewpoints. I appreciate the diversity of ideas. As my
          company begins and grows, I am thankful for the chance you would be a
          part of my journey, as well as me being a part of yours. In my
          personal time, I enjoy songwriting and producing music in my home
          studio, as well as distance running.
