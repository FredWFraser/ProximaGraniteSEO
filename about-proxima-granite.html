          Let me introduce myself, I am <strong>Fred Fraser</strong>, owner and
          operator of Proxima Granite SEO, an SEO consultant for small business.
          Proxima Granite, based in Plaistow, NH, is my brain child and is the
          product of unemployment. I lost my job as software engineer and was
          looking for direction. I took several courses and eventually was led
          to a course in full stack web development. It was a learning
          experience, with lots of highs and some lows and was the toughest
          course I ever took. I thought this was something I could do at home as
          a business. I also discovered something called SEO, which I was
          previously unaware of, and took a couple of courses. I then a took a
          course on WordPress. I wanted to use all my newly found knowledge and
          not be stuck forever in a place called "tutorial hell". So here I am
          embarking on a business adventure to see where it will lead.

          I am a Franklin Pierce University graduate with a major in Computer
          Science. I have worked recently as a software QA engineer, briefly as
          a test technician, as a bill collector and office manager. I love to
          work with others and I come from a technical space so I can work
          comfortably with a developer if the need arises, or work with you on
          the technical aspects of your website. I have worked in a collaborive
          environment and not afraid of opposing viewpoints. I appreciate the
          diversity of ideas. As my company begins and grows, I am thankful for
          the chance you would be a part of my journey, as well as me being a
          part of yours. In my personal time, I enjoy songwriting and producing
          music in my home studio, as well as distance running.
