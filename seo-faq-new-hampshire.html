      <strong>How long does it take to see results from SEO?</strong>
      <p>
        An established site can take 1-3 months to see results. This is a
        crucial period for website audits, keyword research, and technical SEO
        optimizations. A new site can take up to 6 months.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>What makes us (me) different?</strong>
      <p>
        What seperates me from the pack is I come from a technical background. I
        have worked as an engineer, can speak with other developers comfortably,
        can think as a developer as well as a user. I worked in very
        collaborative environment in which we started together from inception to
        production rollout for products. I have also worked with users and
        product owners. I understand code plus the look and feel of
        applications. I have also worked as a general manager with direct client
        contact on the phone and at conventions. I understand business, customer
        service and technology.
      </p>

      <strong>Is there a minimum contract period?</strong>
      <p>
        There are no contracts. We ask that you stay month to month for maximum
        results. You will be invoiced at the beginning of the month. You can opt
        out anytime.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>What does onboarding look like?</strong>
      <p>
        We will have a one-on-one phone call to discuss your needs. You will
        then receive a custom proposal outlining what you will receive from us.
        If we can't help much or at all, we will tell you. Once you agree to the
        proposal, we will get to work on optimizing your website and we will be
        in touch often via phone or email.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>How do you report progress?</strong>
      <p>
        We will be in communication by email or phone on a regular basis, and
        show customized reports at least once per month using Google analytical
        tools.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Will I need to make changes to my website?</strong>
      <p>
        Most likely yes. We can make the changes or work with your developer to
        make the necessary changes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
