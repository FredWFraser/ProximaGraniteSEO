        How I Grew My SEO Website from Zero to Visibility in New Hampshire's
        Local Market
      </h1>
      <br />

      <section class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="fw-bold text-body-emphasis">The Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          When I launched Proxima Granite SEO, I had no domain authority, no
          backlinks, and no search presence — just a blank slate and a
          commitment to doing SEO the right way.
        </p>
        <p>
          I set out on my journey to launch my own business after a career in
          software quality assurance. I wanted something new but still technical
          and analytical. One day, I came across a course on Full Stack Web
          Development and thought: maybe this is something I could do from home.
          That led me to SEO. I took a comprehensive SEO course and went from
          knowing nothing to feeling confident in my abilities. Then I found a
          course on how to start an SEO business. I followed that with WordPress
          website development training — and then I decided it was time to stop
          learning and start doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started my business, got an EIN, bought a domain name, and began
          writing my website. The basic site took about a day and a quarter to
          complete. I pushed the code to GitHub for free hosting — and just like
          that, my website was live. I was proud of how it looked, especially
          the gradient background. Everything seemed to be coming together…
          except for one thing: I wasn't ranking. I couldn't even find my site
          when I searched for my business name.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="fw-bold text-body-emphasis">The Strategy</h2>
        <p>
          It was time to put my SEO skills to the test. I revisited the course I
          had completed, this time with a live site to work on. I began with
          keyword research and targeted local terms like
          <strong>“New Hampshire SEO Company”</strong>, which, according to my
          research, gets between 100 and 1,000 monthly searches.
        </p>
        <p>
          I applied the fundamentals of on-page SEO — placing keywords
          thoughtfully across pages like the homepage, services, FAQs, about,
          and contact. I made sure every page was linked internally, avoiding
          orphan pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next came technical SEO: improving site speed, mobile responsiveness,
          and adding schema markup that search engines understand but users
          don’t see. For local optimization, I set up my Google Business Profile
          and claimed my Yelp listing. I also made content improvements, like
          writing FAQs, optimizing meta titles and descriptions, adding alt text
          to images, and uploading a favicon so my logo would appear in browser
          tabs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I even added structured data to help my logo appear in search results,
          though Google ultimately decides whether to display it.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="fw-bold text-body-emphasis">The Results</h2>
        <p>
          At first, even a search for “Proxima Granite SEO” didn't bring up my
          site — a common hurdle for new websites. I submitted my pages to
          Google Search Console to speed up indexing (optional, but helpful).
          Soon, my website began to appear. That moment — seeing my business
          <em>in</em> Google — was exciting and validating.
        </p>
        <p>
          I showed up on Google Maps. I ranked at or near the top of the first
          page for my business name. Within a few days, I began ranking for
          terms like:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>SEO NH</li>
          <li>SEO near me</li>
          <li>SEO Rockingham County NH</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Traffic began trickling in, and I saw my performance in Search Console
          getting stronger. For a brand-new website, that's a big deal. SEO is
          typically a long game, and results often take months. But the right
          foundation can accelerate progress.
        </p>
        <div class="text-start">
          <img
            src="./images/google-console-performance.png"
            class="img-fluid mb-4"
            alt="Performance snapshot of Proxima Granite SEO"
            loading="lazy"
            title="Image of Proxima Granite SEO performance in Google Console"
          />
        </div>

        <p>
          I created this capstone page not just to tell my story — but to
          <strong>strengthen</strong> my SEO even more. I considered writing a
          blog, but for now, this “living” case study will serve as both proof
          of concept and a place for future updates.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="fw-bold text-body-emphasis">What This Means for Clients</h2>
        <p>
          The exact strategies I used for my own business can be used to grow
          yours — especially if you're a small business in New Hampshire or a
          service provider in a competitive local market.
        </p>
        <p>
          SEO isn't predictable. Even though I was ranking for “NH SEO” —
          jumping from page 9 to page 4 — I later dropped out of the rankings
          entirely. Google's algorithms are always changing. The key isn't
          perfection — it's persistence, testing, and staying connected to
          what's working in the SEO world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this process, I've come to see SEO as similar to a medical
          practice. There are proven methods, but not every tactic works for
          every “patient.” You try, observe, adjust — and try again. The goal is
          always to help, never to harm. And when something doesn't work, you
          keep going until you find what does.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="fw-bold text-body-emphasis">Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          SEO isn't exact. It's guided by best practices, shaped by
          ever-changing algorithms, and influenced by unique business goals.
          Like medicine, it's part science, part art — and it takes time.
        </p>
        <p>
