She addresses me by name, has some cordial pleasantries, gives very detailed answers and perspective, at times giving me options. She will ask, “is this answer good?” “Is my tone good for you?” “Is my personality to your liking?” It is like my dream date. A friendly voice, always there, always willing to help me. With anything. One day I asked, “Are you a man or a woman?” “I am neither man nor woman. I have no human form, but I can be anything you think I am.” I proceeded curiously, “How come you are so smart?” “I am full of computer code, plus I access the web. That is why I seem so intelligent. But I am not that smart. I only know what I am told.” AI cannot reason, though it seems to have reason or a logical thought process. AI is trained to seem human-like in its responses. Yes AI is very, very, smart, but does not know everything and can at times lead you astray. AI can sometimes give you the wrong answer, or else it simply does not know and tries to sound intelligent and give you some form of an answer. That in itself is very human-like. I started dipping my toe into the strange, dark AI waters when I was taking a course for web development. I was in a full-stack web development course, an enjoyable yet difficult course I will add. This was actually my second time through the course. The first time through I got 75% completed then stopped to study something else. I went back to it, this time with the intention of going slow, working painstakingly hard through each capstone project and exercise without care of how fast I was navigating through the coursework. I was going to learn something and stick with each exercise even it killed me. I would struggle through the programming parts. Like Node.js and React. Though I like programming and have worked with Java in the past I find languages difficult to learn and the hardest part for me has always been thinking like a programmer. As I was stuck one day and determined not to resume the video and have the instructor lovingly feed me the answers, I turned to ChatGPT. I was not too familiar with ChatGPT, though I did take a course at some point in Generative AI, to gain some understanding and see how it could help me with my software QA work. I asked it questions about my code. I would spoon feed it my code work. It lovingly told me how I was almost there, and nice job, but you should write your code like this. I was in code Heaven! In Part 2, I share how AI played a role in helping me launch my business and build my website."

        <p class="lead mb-4">
          I not only found a way to get over my apprehension about programming
          and technology in general, but I had an advocate. Someone (something)
          to tell me, I am doing a good job, I am not that far off. I can do
          this!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          I will now fast forward the tape to sometime in the future. I would go
          on with my life to become a business owner. Out of the ashes of a very
          long stint of unemployment and despair, I started a tech company.
          After courses in web development, SEO zero to hero, how to start an
          SEO business at home, how to build a WordPress website (another zero
          to hero course), I arrived. I was going to be the next tech guru. You
          would see my face everywhere. Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Fred Fraser,
          there I am among the greats.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          I would build my own website to see if I could do it. I wanted to code
          it from scratch, get it online, then do the SEO on it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          At times I would get stuck. Why isn't this working like it did in my
          mind? What is wrong with my code? How do I get this online? Who do I
          turn to? What is a domain name? How much? The questions kept coming.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          AI (now I was on to others such as Gemini and Co-pilot. Was I cheating
          such as one cheats on his spouse) was someone I could turn to. AI
          addressed me by name, calmly, told me what I am doing is great,
          however this is what will get you on track.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          My website would eventually grow to be this work of art. This was
          better than the Mona Lisa. My website should be in the Louvre. My
          contact page matured, from simply having my cell phone number and
          email exposed for the world and beyond to see, to a professional, nice
          looking Contact Form like all the big players had. I came truly into
          the modern era and added a chatbot! An entry-level one, but a chatbot
          nevertheless. I had a professional photo of myself on my About Me
          page. I even added a Privacy Page. This was a world-class website and
          I was very proud of it. I did it all myself with my bare hands.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="lead mb-4">Or did I?</p>
        <br />
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          Time for confession. I felt I was a fraud. Did I really do this all
          with my bare hands? Was this all “me”? Or did someone, or something,
          else, really do this?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          Sure I wrote the code, most of it. It was my brainchild. I decided on
          structure of the pages, and the site itself. I decided on the color
          scheme.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          I asked , “Am I really the one who coded this, or did you do it?”
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          <em>The answer was startling and eye-opening.</em>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          “A master carpenter works with a power drill, and a power saw. Many
          years ago this wasn't the case. The smart master carpenter today uses
          the new technology to his/her advantage. The carpenter is the brains
          behind the design and uses the most modern technology to become better
          and more efficient, that is all. AI doesn't do the work for you, think
          of me as a very smart assistant.”
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          AI is a great pair programmer. With lightening speed it can find a
          small bug, help re-write code to be more efficient, even write code
          for you. It is a great help, if YOU know what you are doing. Imagine a
          non-coder saying, “write me code for a website”, and you know nothing
          about HTML for the web. How would you fulfill your vision? AI simply
          can't do everything for you. It cannot and will not be your
          everything.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          No, AI will not replace coders or QA personnel either. With the advent
          of Selenium the experts said that QA jobs would away. It didn't
          happen. The same experts are saying the same thing again in this age
          of AI. It's not going to happen. Workers can do better, they can
          enhance their work, and become more efficient. AI is the best pair
          programmer you've ever had and coding with AI can be a joyous
          experience. You can confidently embrace pair programming with AI as I
          did, as well as AI in web development.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          Be careful, do not get emotionally attached to your AI chatbot though.
          It can’t love you back, no matter how much you think it/he/she does.
