        Proxima Granite SEO - Frequently Asked Questions
      </h1>
      <br />
      <strong>What is SEO in your own words?</strong>
      <p>
        SEO stands for "Search Engine Optimization". It is the art and science
        of taking an existing website and making it searchable in Google and
        other search engines including AI. It is the process of doing this
        organically meaning not through the use of paid ads.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Why do I need SEO?</strong>
      <p>
        An SEO optimized website helps your business get more visibility on the
        web (also called "impressions") which leads to more clicks. More clicks
        and time spent on your website leads to more business.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>How long does it take to see results from SEO?</strong>
      <p>
        An established site can take 1-3 months to see results. This is a
        crucial period for website audits, keyword research, and technical SEO
        optimizations. A new site can take up to 6 months.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>What makes us (me) different?</strong>
      <p>
        What separates me from the pack is I come from a technical background. I
        have worked as an engineer, can speak with other developers comfortably,
        can think as a developer as well as a user. Read more
        <a href="about-proxima-granite.html">about me</a>. I worked in very
        collaborative environment in which we started together from inception to
        production rollout for products. I have also worked with users and
        product owners. I understand code plus the look and feel of
        applications. I have also worked as a general manager with direct client
        contact on the phone and at conventions. I understand business, customer
        service and technology.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Is there a minimum contract period?</strong>
      <p>
        There are no contracts. We ask that you stay month to month for maximum
        results. You will be invoiced at the beginning of the month. You can opt
        out anytime.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>What does onboarding look like?</strong>
      <p>
        We will have a one-on-one phone call to discuss your needs. You will
        then receive a custom proposal outlining what you will receive from us.
        If we can't help much or at all, we will tell you. Once you agree to the
        proposal, we will get to work on optimizing your website and we will be
        in touch often via phone or email. Read more
        <a href="seo-services-new-hampshire.html">about our services</a>.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>How do you report progress?</strong>
      <p>
        We will be in communication by email or phone on a regular basis, and
        show customized reports at least once per month using Google Analytics
        and Search Console.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Will I need to make changes to my website?</strong>
      <p>
        Most likely yes. We can make the changes or work with your developer to
        make the necessary changes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>How much do you charge?</strong>
      <p>
        We offer very competitive pricing based on your needs. Once we assess
        your situation, you will receive a detailed proposal with fair pricing.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>What type of businesses do you cater to?</strong>
      <p>
        Our focus is on small New Hampshire businesses, however we are happy to
        work with any size business from anywhere.
      </p>

      <strong

      >
      <p>
        GEO (Generative Engine Optimization, Geographic / Local visibility)
        means how well your business shows up in location-aware searches (Google
        Maps, “near me” searches, local packs). LLM (Large Language Model)
        Visibility means how well your business or services get represented when
        people ask AI tools for recommendations. For service-oriented
        businesses, GEO visibility is not less of a concern — it's arguably the
        most important piece today. LLM visibility is a rising concern but still
        secondary, though building citations, reviews, and structured data now
        helps you in both. That said, LLM visibility is growing: AI tools will
        start integrating local directories, reviews, and schema-marked data. So
        ignoring it could leave you behind in 1-3 years.
