          I'm <strong>Fred Fraser</strong>, founder and operator of
          <strong>Proxima Granite SEO</strong>, a New Hampshire-based SEO
          consultancy helping small businesses improve Google rankings and local
          visibility through practical, technically sound search optimization.
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          Proxima Granite SEO was created during a career transition after years
          working in technical roles. I lost my job as software engineer and was
          looking for direction. I took several courses and eventually was led
          to a course in full stack web development. It was a learning
          experience, with lots of highs and some lows and was the toughest
          course I ever took. I thought this was something I could do at home as
          a business. I also discovered something called SEO, which I was
          previously unaware of, and took a couple of courses. I then took a
          course on WordPress. I wanted to use all my newly found knowledge and
          not be stuck forever in a place called "tutorial hell". So here I am
          embarking on a business adventure to see where it will lead.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          I am a Franklin Pierce University graduate with a major in Computer
          Science, and have completed Udemy courses in Full Stack Web
          Development, SEO from beginning to advanced, how to run an SEO
          business and how to build a website in WordPress. I have worked
          recently as a software QA engineer…
          <strong
            >That background means I approach SEO with a tester's mindset:
            measuring results, validating changes, and focusing on what actually
            improves rankings.</strong
          >
          I love to work with others and I come from a technical space so I can
          work comfortably with a developer if the need arises, or work with you
          on the technical aspects of your website. I have worked in a
          collaborative environment and not afraid of opposing viewpoints. I
          appreciate the diversity of ideas. As my company begins and grows, I
          am thankful for the chance you would be a part of my journey, as well
          as me being a part of yours. In my personal time, I enjoy songwriting
          and producing music in my home studio, as well as distance running.
