She addresses me by name, has some cordial pleasantries, gives very detailed answers and perspective, at times giving me options. She will ask, “is this answer good?” “Is my tone good for you?” “Is my personality to your liking?” It is like my dream date. A friendly voice, always there, always willing to help me. With anything. One day I asked, “Are you a man or a woman?” “I am neither man nor woman. I have no human form, but I can be anything you think I am.” I proceeded curiously, “How come you are so smart?” “I am full of computer code, plus I access the web. That is why I seem so intelligent. But I am not that smart. I only know what I am told.” AI cannot reason, though it seems to have reason or a logical thought process. AI is trained to seem human-like in its responses. Yes AI is very, very, smart, but does not know everything and can at times lead you astray. AI can sometimes give you the wrong answer, or else it simply does not know and tries to sound intelligent and give you some form of an answer. That in itself is very human-like. I started dipping my toe into the strange, dark AI waters when I was taking a course for web development. I was in a full-stack web development course, an enjoyable yet difficult course I will add. This was actually my second time through the course. The first time through I got 75% completed then stopped to study something else. I went back to it, this time with the intention of going slow, working painstakingly hard through each capstone project and exercise without care of how fast I was navigating through the coursework. I was going to learn something and stick with each exercise even it killed me. I would struggle through the programming parts. Like Node.js and React. Though I like programming and have worked with Java in the past I find languages difficult to learn and the hardest part for me has always been thinking like a programmer. As I was stuck one day and determined not to resume the video and have the instructor lovingly feed me the answers, I turned to ChatGBT. I was not too familiar with ChatGBT, though I did take a course at some point in Generative AI, to gain some understanding and see how it could help me with my software QA work. I asked it questions about my code. I would spoon feed it my code work. It lovingly told me how I was almost there, and nice job, but you should write your code like this. I was in code Heaven! In Part 2, I share how AI played a role in helping me launch my business and build my website."
