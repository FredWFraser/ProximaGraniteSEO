            evolution of Proxima Granite SEO.
            <strong>We're now a hybrid service + SaaS company,</strong>
            combining hands-on local SEO expertise with software we build
            ourselves. Instead of relying solely on expensive commercial
            platforms, we create solutions tailored to real small-business
            needs.

          <p class="lead mb-4">
            While many marketing companies depend entirely on commercial tools,
            we take a different path. We engineer our own. Proxima Pulse is
            designed to be fast, accurate, intuitive, and far less complicated
            than the industry-standard dashboards that overwhelm more than they
            help.

        <br />
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          "Proxima" generally refers to Proxima Centauri, the closest star to
          our Sun. It is a red dwarf star located in the constellation
          Centaurus, approximately 4.24 light-years away. "Granite" refers to
          New Hampshire being known as the "Granite State". Granite also
          symbolizes <strong>strength, durability and endurance.</strong> Just
          like that star, we strive to be the clear choice for New Hampshire
          businesses searching for a better online presence.
